Use mock data or simulate API calls.

add warning like - "this is a demo for getting feebcak and tractions. the real product may be different along with all ui/ux , pricing and features. ", "This is a demo version of the product intended for collecting feedback and measuring early traction.
The final product may differ significantly in terms of UI/UX, features, and pricing.

Backend can be simple ‚Äî just to handle file requests/actions.

Show loading indicators while fetching files.

This is an MVP for demo/testing ‚Äî polish and features can be light, but core actions should work.
